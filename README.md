# ProbSolvingviaOOP
Contains projects built in my CS 10 class at Dartmouth. The class is titled Problem Solving via Object-Oriented Programming and is a course in data structures and algorithms in Java.

PSet4 files contain code for problem set 4 which was building the Kevin Bacon game in a way that user inputs could be put in and different simulations could be run in the game. 

The bacon file directory contains the input files needed to build and run the game. The PS4Final directory contains the code, an analysis of test cases, and a discussion of boundary inputs.

We have not modified the code since we wrote it for class because we believe that although we know better now, the code as is represents a point in our learning experience that we want to record--it works well, but could be made more efficient. Future programs will embody this efficiency.
